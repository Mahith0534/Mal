# Malware Detection App
# Description: 
Developed a comprehensive system for detecting malicious behaviors in Android applications using static and dynamic analysis techniques combined with machine learning.
# Key Contributions:
Implemented static analysis using androguard to extract permissions, activities, services, and receivers from APK files.
Conducted dynamic analysis by leveraging frida to monitor and hook into app behaviors at runtime.
Extracted features from both static and dynamic analyses to train a machine learning model using scikit-learn, achieving an accuracy of X% in distinguishing between benign and malicious apps.
Integrated the detection system with VirusTotal API for additional signature-based verification.
Utilized Python and relevant libraries (androguard, frida, scikit-learn) to build and automate the analysis pipeline.
